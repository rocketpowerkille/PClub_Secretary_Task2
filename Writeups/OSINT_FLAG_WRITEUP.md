FLAG - PClub{idk_how_this_got_typed}

So the author's real name was Kalpit Lal Rama and after checking the source of the page and using inspect element I found nothing.

So I just googled his name which led me to this LinkedIn and there it had a link to a twitter account.

In the bio of that account I found the reddit account u/Virtual-Copy-637 which had a few random rowing posts in which I found nothing after doing steg.

There was this 8 month old post which had these random numbers with a comment hinting to use them.

Upon trying all the permutations of recipes on cyberchef I got frustrated and just put the numbers on dcode.fr cipher analyzer and it gave base 36 as the best option , upon translating got the link for a insta account (https://www.instagram.com/i_like_anonymity_sometimes1212/)

upon analyzing all the posts and the spam highlight(and wasting my 15 mins on the Mahe Drysdale wiki cause the photo was different)I was finally on the Thomas keller medal wiki page.

And since the highlight said - "hope i didn't leak something" thinking Wikipedia is editable i viewed the edit history of the page and taking the date 29th September from the highlight , I saw the edit on that day from user Kapilx19 and clicking on the difference options which shows us the edit between the changed and original site I got this fake flag(Fake cause well all the flags had format PClub{})

I noticed in the edit history another recent edit from a account named KapilLal20 which is similar to our previous user and on viewing its contributions finally found the real flag and clues for the next 2 flags.
