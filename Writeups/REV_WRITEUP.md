Well sadly did not find the flag for this one.

downloaded the challenge file and opened it in 'IDA'

saw a whole lot of files and well panicked cause I had not idea what I should do now 

uploaded both the main folder and encoding folder completely to let gpt analyze what to do

it gave me a base code which had a few errors but gpt claims it would have generated the flag if not for the errors

also found like this target hex = "6b50928708d30d85c1dbe9fe69101897f88908c907452a44a8"

but in the end lost to this challenge and decided to just give up :(
